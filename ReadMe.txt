================= NCRAFT - BY LOIC PUJET =================
==========================================================

nCraft is a free 3D Minecraft-like game for the TI-Nspire.
It should work on every Nspire : CX or grayscale, CAS or
non-CAS.

This is an alpha version, the final version will be much
more complete.


Controls :

- Arrows : turn the camera
- 8 : go forward
- 5 or 2 : go backward
- 4 and 6 : strafe
- tab : remove a block
- ctrl : add a block
- + and - : choose the selected block
- F : render the full world


Legal stuff :

nCraft has nothing to do with Mojang or Texas Instruments.
It is a free, open-source third-party program.
I am not responsible if it causes any damage to your
calculator.
